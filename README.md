# Gadget Grotto - Team project

This project's objectives was to create an e-commerce website to sell a pre-determined list of gadget items.
Alongside teammates [Daniel Atak](https://github.com/dan-atack), [Rony Kordahi](https://github.com/RonyKordahi), and [Craig Nockels](https://github.com/CraigNock), I developed Gadget Grotto!
